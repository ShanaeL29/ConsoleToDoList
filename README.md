JavaScript: Console ToDo List

Very simple demonstration of loop implementation using JavaScript!

Console MUST be open and visible.

User should be able to add a new task by inputting "new" when initially prompted "What would you like to do?".

User can then add a new task of their choosing. The task will be added to a list and maintained until the app is "quit".

If user would like a list of their current tasks, they can input "list" when prompted "What would you like to do?". This will display the current list of tasks in the console along with their index.

If user would like to delete a task they should first view the list and determine the index of the desired item to delete. User should then enter "delete" when prompted "What would you like to do? User should enter only the index number related to the specific task from the list view.

When the user is done with the application they should enter "quit" when prompt appears.

If the user enters any other input they will receive an alert. Clicking "Ok" will close the alert and initiate new prompt.
